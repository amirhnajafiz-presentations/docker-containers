					<p>
						The concept of containers was started way back in 1979 with UNIX chroot. 
						It's an UNIX operating-system system call for changing the root directory of a 
						process and it's children to a new location in the filesystem which is 
						only visible to a given process.<br /><br />
						The 2000s were alight with container technology development and refinement. 
						Google introduced Borg, the organization's container cluster management system, in 2003. 
						It relied on the isolation mechanisms that Linux already had in place.<br /><br />
						Until 2004 that linux added the Cgropus and Namespaces which started a big 
						evolution in containers industery.

					<h3>
						Containers: Isolation
					</h3>
					<p>
						Container isolation involves isolating a containerized application's 
						runtime environment from the host operating system and other 
						processes running on the host.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h3>
						Containers: Architecture
					</h3>
					<p>
						A <span class="green-highlight">containerized</span> architecture makes it possible to package 
						software and its dependencies in an isolated unit, called a container, 
						which can run consistently in any environment.
					</p>
					<img src="assets/architecture.png" width="500" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Cgroup
					</h3>
					<p>
						Cgroups (abbreviated from <span class="red-highlight">control groups</span>) 
						is a Linux kernel feature that limits,
						accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, 
						network, etc.) of a collection of processes.
						Engineers at Google started the work on this feature in 2006 
						under the name <span class="blue-highlight">process containers</span>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Namespace
					</h3>
					<p>
						Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel 
						resources such that one set of processes <span class="red-highlight">
						sees one set of resources while another</span>
						set of processes sees a different set of resources.<br />
						Namespaces provide isolation of system resources, and cgroups allow for 
						<span class="blue-highlight">fineâ€‘grained control and enforcement of limits for those resources</span>. 
						Containers are not the only way that you can use namespaces and cgroups.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						RunC
					</h3>
					<p>
						RunC is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the 
						<span class="green-highlight">OCI specification</span>.
						RunC is a universal container runtime created by <span class="blue-highlight">Docker
						</span>. View it on
						<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">
							Github
						</a>.
					</p>
					<pre><code>
# creating a new containers
runc create mycontainerid

# view the container is created and in the "created" state
runc list

# start the process inside the container
runc start mycontainerid

# now delete the container
runc delete mycontainerid
					</code></pre>

					<h3>
						Docker
					</h3>
					<p>
						Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
						Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything 
						the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Docker created
						<span class="blue-highlight">RunC</span> in order to manage containers on a system.
					</p>

					<h3>
						Docker: Image
					</h3>
					<p>
						A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of 
						instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform.
						An image is a <span class="green-highlight">file that represents a packaged application with all the 
						dependencies needed to run correctly</span>. 
						In other words, we could say that a Docker image is like a Java class. 
						Images are built as a series of layers. Layers are assembled on top of one another.
						<span class="red-highlight">Layers can also be cached</span>.

					<h3>
						Docker: Image (cont.)
					</h3>
					<p>
						Image commands:
					</p>
					<pre><code>
# pull docker image
$ docker pull nginx:latest

# get a list of docker images
$ docker image ls

# build your docker image
$ docker build . -t amirhossein21/nginx:v0.1

# remove an image
$ docker image remove amirhossein21/nginx:v0.1
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Docker: Container
					</h3>
					<p>
						A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that 
						includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries 
						and settings.
					</p>
					<img src="assets/containers.jpeg" width="450" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Docker: Container (cont.)
					</h3>
					<p>
						The key difference between a Docker image and a container is that a Docker 
						image is a read-only immutable template that defines how a container will be realized.<br />
						A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image that gets created 
						when the <span class="blue-highlight">$ docker run command</span> is implemented.
